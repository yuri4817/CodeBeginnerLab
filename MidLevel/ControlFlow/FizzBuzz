"""
The fizzBuzz function generates a sequence of numbers up to a given natural number n.
In this sequence, numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with "Fizz", those divisible by 5 with "Buzz", and those divisible by both 3 and 5 with "FizzBuzz". If a number is not divisible by either, it is displayed as is.
Complete this function to return the sequence as a string, with each number or word separated by a hyphen "-".
